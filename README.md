# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.
 Developed a full-stack web application for the E-Cell (Entrepreneurship Cell) website using Next.js, React, and TypeScript, and deployed it on Vercel for fast and scalable hosting. Implemented secure authentication and profile management with Firebase Authentication and Firestore to ensure reliable data handling. Designed a modern, responsive UI with Tailwind CSS and ShadCN, enabling the platform to actively publish updates and manage E-Cell content for students and organizers.
